 * Implements REST endpoints for the application.
 *
 * Please note that the documentation for these classes is quite short. These are not supposed to be used directly by
 * users but are mostly automatically constructed and called by Dropwizard/Jersey. A lot of functionality is also
 * hidden in the annotations. Please read at least the introduction to Dropwizard development to get a feel of what
 * this package is doing and how.
